Introduction and Goals

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually, or 31% of all global deaths, according to the World Health Organization. These conditions often progress silently and unpredictably, making early and accurate diagnosis vital for improving outcomes. Coronary artery disease, a prominent form of CVD, poses a substantial risk even to asymptomatic individuals, highlighting the clinical urgency of noninvasive, data-driven screening techniques. Conventional diagnostic methods often rely on subjective assessment of symptoms or static threshold-based risk scores, which may not fully capture the nuanced interplay between demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors. 

Our overarching goal is to investigate whether recent advances in neural architectures for tabular data—specifically, NODE (Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles) and TabNet—as well as ensemble learning approaches, can yield meaningful improvements in predictive performance and model interpretability over traditional methods. By bridging methods from classical machine learning (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes) and deep learning (e.g., RNNs, transformer-inspired attention mechanisms), we aim to assess both accuracy and practical utility of these models in clinical decision-making. We will also explore the integration of models across frameworks such as PyHealth, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn to construct ensemble learners that are optimized for healthcare applications.
